# Tic Tac Toe Game with AI
| Author & Developer: Carl Villarosa
Create an unbeatable AI using Minimax Algorithm.

## References

For this project, I used these following sources for understanding TicTacToe with the Minimax Algorithm.
https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax - Jason Fox

## Dependencies

We will use the random module for Python
```Python
pip install random
```

## Start

I will use the basis of Kylie's code for the creation of the program, however I will do it by scratch.

Firstly, I would need to visualize what is needed for a perfect TicTacToe game. 

A computer that would either bring out a draw or a win.

In a short summary, The computer would need to calculate all the possible moves available then use a metric to determine the best possible move.

## Functions

I will need the following functions:

Function | Purpose 
--- | --- 
`init_board` | initialize the tictactoe board 
`display_board` | display the board 
`is_full` | check if the board is full 
`game_over` | check if the game is a win or draw
`available_moves` | get all the available moves 
`minimax` | minimax algo
`best_move` | find best move for AI
`main` | main game
